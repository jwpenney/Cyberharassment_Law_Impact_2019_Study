## Data and Analysis Repository 

For the study discussed in this article, we use data collected via an online survey in March 2015. The dataset thus constituted 1,296 total survey responses from internet users based in the United States, with sixty-four survey responses excluded for being substantially incomplete (defined by ten or more questions left unansweredâ€”many of these were likely false starts by respondents). 

## Analysis
In the survey case study, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, a common statistical method for analyzing survey data, was used to statistically analyze findings, as it allowed for all relevant variables to be controlled in order to isolate relationships.
